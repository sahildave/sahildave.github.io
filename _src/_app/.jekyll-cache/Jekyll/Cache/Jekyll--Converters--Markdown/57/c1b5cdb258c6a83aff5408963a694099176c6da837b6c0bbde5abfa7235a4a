I"©<p>Boolean operations are a very powerful tool in any Product and/or Graphics design application. A complicated looking shape can be constructed in no time using the four options present in Sketch, namely Union, Subtract, Intersect and Difference.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this article came after spending hours drooling over the icons that <a href="https://twitter.com/marcedwards/status/863611285275107328">Marc Edward</a> made in his new Imgur album ‚ÄúVector icon speed runs‚Äù. Make sure to check it out.</p>

<p>Although, by the looks of it, he is using Adobe Illustrator and there are a few other things that Marc does in his speed run; in almost all of the flows he uses some kind of Boolean Operation.</p>

<hr />

<p>Getting on point, there are four kinds of Boolean Operations which are available in Sketch. You can save, print and stick the images below in your design bay, compel yourself to use it when needed.</p>
