I"ž<p>As a designer, I believe side projects are of utmost importance. You get to experiment with various scenarios working on a new topic and it dramatically enhances your skill. On the other hand, I also believe that designers are pretty protective about their work. We take immense shame in accepting if we fail at improving a product through design. But as they say, failing and failure are different things.</p>
