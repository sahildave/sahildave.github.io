I"'<p>In the last post I had discussed how we are using product flavors to release different versions of the code base with minor changes. It had helped us serve different clients with different requirements.
In this post I would share how we release multiple split libraries and have interdependencies similar to how Google releases play-services or appcompat libraries. It seems easy till the publishing day, until it is not! The problem with inter-dependency is maven does not add the version number in the pom file for local module dependencies.</p>
