      "content": "<p>As a designer, I believe side projects are of utmost importance. You get to experiment with various scenarios working on a new topic and it dramatically enhances your skill. On the other hand, I also believe that designers are pretty protective about their work. We take immense shame in accepting if we fail at improving a product through design. But as they say, failing and failure are different things.</p>\n\n<p>While trying to improve Google Translate’s functional design, Indhuja and I faced a lot of roadblocks. Naturally, these were expected. Firstly, this was a side project and we had no data about the usage of any particular feature. Secondly, our aim was also to keep the Information Architecture unchanged. But given the givens, we still think we are succeeding, through one learning at a time. We understood what a wonderful product Google Translate is, at its core. And this astonishing learning gave us immense respect for the product team at Google Translate who might be facing these issues on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"inception\">Inception</h2>\n\n<p>The idea came into being when we were looking for a new product to work upon in January. We always try to improve the functional aspect of an app with our redesigns and not just the UI.</p>\n\n<p>We moved to the wunderbar city of Berlin a few months ago and Translate has been a saviour. A tweet from Alex Münch caught Indhuja’s eye and it all fell into place. We thought Google translate would be an interesting project to be occupied with. There are googol (pun intended) number of “redesigns” on dribbble which don’t really serve any purpose, and we hate it. We started with trying to solve one problem this time - Reachability.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"what-wechanged\">What we changed</h2>\n\n<p>Nobody can deny that the technology behind Translate is unparallel but there are some UX issues which we intended to solve. We wanted to keep things at a quick reach. Whenever the user is at home or at a grocery shop they’d want the most used actions, Type and Camera, nearby. So naturally, we thought of putting them all near the thumb.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reach\">Reach</h3>\n\n<p>With the home screen, we aimed to keep things near the thumb without changing the Information Architecture of the page. On one hand, we dropped the icon labels for the Camera and Mic. On the other, we added more information to the Conversation and Handwriting actions. The assumption here was that the user would be familiar with buttons like Camera and Mic. And as the Conversation and Handwriting felt focussed more towards power users, they should have more information attached.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/translate-ch-1/home.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"the-user-can-now-quickly-access-the-camera-and-mic-the-cards-for-conversation-and-handwriting-provide-more-context\">The user can now quickly access the Camera and Mic. The cards for Conversation and Handwriting provide more context.</h6>\n\n<h3 id=\"guide-withcolour\">Guide with Colour</h3>\n\n<p>Taking inspiration from Google Tasks and Assistant for the Material Design 2.0 UI, we went with an all white and blue approach. We wanted the main action of a state to be highlighted with the blue colour. As the primary need for the user while using the app was to view the translated text we tried to keep the translated text in-blue or on-blue.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/translate-ch-1/home-typing-result.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"colours-are-used-to-guide-the-users-attention-at-different-stages-of-the-product\">Colours are used to guide the user’s attention at different stages of the product</h6>\n\n<p>In the home state, the language switcher was on-blue. While typing, the real-time translation is in-blue. And finally, in the result screen, the translation is on-blue. This not only brings vibrance in the UI but also directs the user’s eye to the highlighted part of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>This notion was shattered when we read the article by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pendar\">Pendar Yousefi</a> published while we were doing this project though.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"making-itseamless\">Making it seamless</h3>\n\n<p>There was a need for a smoother experience. Currently, the input boxes ‘jump’ up and down a lot between the three home-typing-result states. We aimed at cleaning that up by keeping components stacked from the bottom. This should also help in keeping a minimal number of screens as the transitions can be smooth when the keyboard pops up.\nNow the problems started cropping up.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"recents--suggestions\">Recents &amp; Suggestions</h3>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, showing a “Recents” list is easier if the list has an infinite space below it. The natural behaviour for the user is to scroll that list and view his history in a descending fashion.</p>\n\n<p>But, we had the input box at the bottom! So the list couldn’t be infinite. Next, keeping the height of short phones like iPhone 5/SE in mind, there was enough space for only maximum 3 items above the input boxes. So, in the end, we had only this tiny vertical space for all the things - recent, suggestions, “Did you mean” and “Translate from”.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/translate-ch-1/sugg-did-from.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"quick-suggestions-did-you-mean-and-translate-fromall-come-in-the-same-location\">Quick-Suggestions, Did you mean and Translate from — all come in the same location</h6>\n\n<h3 id=\"language-switcher\">Language Switcher</h3>\n\n<p>We experimented with placing the language switcher component to many different locations on the screen and somehow gain some more vertical space. This was going contrary to our aim of keeping a minimum number of screens. Changing the language switcher to a small vertical switch on the left helped us gain some vertical space and it inadvertently aligned all the text elements as well.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/translate-ch-1/switcher.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"few-of-the-many-iterations-of-the-language-switcher\">Few of the many iterations of the language switcher</h6>\n\n<h3 id=\"result-screen\">Result Screen</h3>\n\n<p>This was the straw that broke the camel’s back. We morphed the “typing” state into the result screen for a smooth experience. Here the result is on top, highlighted on-blue, and more information is down under the keyboard. It looked good in its own domain but was very different from the home screen. The user could only click the cross icon to go back home.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/translate-ch-1/result.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"comparison-of-the-result-screens-results-are-shown-on-top-of-the-screen\">Comparison of the result screens. Results are shown on top of the screen.</h6>\n\n<p>We can certainly make smooth Flinto prototypes and it will look awesome. But then if you compare this with the current app, you’d say that the simplicity was lost.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/translate-ch-1/flow.gif\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"a-quick-flinto-of-the-4-major-states\">A quick Flinto of the 4 major states.</h6>\n\n<h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned</h2>\n\n<p>On the first glance of the current app, a redesign looked simple. But we couldn’t be more wrong. We just scratched the surface. There was a certain complexity in the simplicity and we missed it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There was a certain complexity in the simplicity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This astonishing reveal is the reason we are now learning more about the product - like the intricacies of the user flows and the original aim of the service as envisioned by Google- “Speak to the World”.\nWe started only with reachability in mind but now we see the product as a whole from a more zoomed out view. And while seeing a product from up there, you tend to notice a few more things from a design standpoint. That’s why you need to raise your head above the water once in a while rather than being drowned in it, all day.</p>\n\n<p>We needed the fail to see things clearly. Now, instead of redesigning Google Translate, we have decided to work on the product as a whole.\nWe’d be writing more about this endeavour as we progress. Stay tuned!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"interesting-links\">Interesting links:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/google-design/a-fish-in-your-ear-134deed70268\">Designing the UI of Google Translate - Google Design</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/google-design/3-ux-takeaways-from-redesigning-google-translate-3184038f43bf\">3 UX takeaways from redesigning Google Translate - Google Design</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://material.io/design/components/\">Material Design 2.0</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/translate-ch-1/credits.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"co-written-with-indhuja\">Co-written with Indhuja.</h6>\n\n<p>This post was originally seen <a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/how-we-succeeded-by-failing-to-redesign-google-translate-e9177e0e146e\">here</a> on Medium.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Ostrich Books was started to solve problems with book availability and the high cost. Books are either not available in the local store or are costly if ordered online. Getting suggestion online is even worse. If you are an avid reader, you’d not like the Amazon and Goodreads recommendation system. If you are an avid reader, you’d have a really bad time online.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/app-showcase.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The Problem</h2>\n\n<p>There are only a few good bookstores in Bangalore and even lesser number of libraries. And after making an astronomical number of calls to a bookstore and confirming they have the book, you chicken out because of the worsening Bangalore traffic. One of the biggest store in Bangalore would have almost all of the book and frankly it was a major point of purchase for Ostrich too; but the quality is not that great.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/amazon.jpeg\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"the-pop-culture-and-increasing-number-of-book-to-movie-adaptation-have-skewed-the-bestselling-lists-in-amazon-india-and-goodreads\">The pop culture and increasing number of book-to-movie adaptation have skewed the bestselling lists in Amazon India and Goodreads.</h6>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A woman walking on the pavement overtook my car eight times and my car overtook her eight times. Two more times and we would have been engaged.</p>\n  <footer>\n    <cite><a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/content/582631/jeffrey-archer-amused-blurus-infamous.html\">Jeffrey Archer on Bangalore traffic</a></cite>\n  </footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/blr-traffic-library.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"left-blossom-book-store-right-bangalores-daily-traffic\">(Left) Blossom book store. (Right) Bangalore’s daily traffic.”</h6>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-process\">The Process</h2>\n\n<p>Being the designer &amp; engineer co-founder of the team, I had all the non-business responsibilities. We needed a customer facing app and a working admin dashboard, and all of it in just 2 months. Prior to Ostrich, I had done that multiple times but this time the catch was that those products were from an established company. Creating new product(s) for a new company is different. You conceptualize the logo, branding, present it, argue about it and go back to the drawing board. Developing an app comes after that.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/git-trello.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"my-gantt-charts-were-off-the-charts\">My Gantt charts were off the charts.</h6>\n\n<p>Being the solo developer, I built the Android app, laid down the foundation for the backend, created serverless modules, created admin panels and many other side projects. I also lead the product marketing and community engagement. As the internet was undergoing an incredible transformation in India and the number of Android users was increasing by the day, I chose to go with Google’s Material Design. It was 2015 and users were getting comfortable with this new design system.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I chose not to go with some fancy animations as phones in India are pretty slow. In one of my user interview, I saw a user open the <i>Book Detail</i> page with an extreme stutter because of the element transition animation from the bottom. I decided to scrap that animation and went with the simple translation like a bottom sheet.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/rapid-proto.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"rapid-prototyping-was-done-not-with-after-effects-but-directly-in-the-code-there-was-very-little-time-to-create-a-design-prototype-and-then-implementing-it\">Rapid prototyping was done; not with After Effects but directly in the code. There was very little time to create a design prototype and then implementing it.</h6>\n\n<p>Another result of rapid prototyping was that our internal processes were also made rapid. We would do the <b>User Research</b> while delivering the book. We would ask them about their experience with the app. If they were a returning user, we would have a list of old conversations and interview them about the latest changes that they see.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/notif.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"notifications-played-an-important-role-i-made-a-gcm-module-where-in-you-could-send-a-trending-facebook-post-and-it-would-be-shown-to-interested-users-on-the-fly\">Notifications played an important role. I made a GCM module where in you could send a trending Facebook post and it would be shown to interested users, on the fly.</h6>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-product\">The Product</h2>\n<p>Ostrich was launched. To promote reading and making it easy was our main objective.\nYou search for a book and start reading a physical copy in a matter of hours.\nYou can lend your own books and get 3 in return.\nYou could rent a full book set or buy it at a discounted price.\nMeet an author or chat with fellow readers at specially organised event.\n<strong>Experience books not just the story.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the end, after an app update was released, we’d have learned a lot from the process and implement the design changes in our social media posts as well. I think I won’t be wrong saying that iterating UI design helped us in improving our social media content too.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/logo.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"the-name-and-the-logo-for-ostrich-defined-progress-a-fast-one-ostrich-being-the-fastest-land-bird-with-a-long-neck-denoted-the-pace-and-the-reach-we-wanted-to-have-respectively\">The name and the logo for Ostrich defined progress, a fast one. Ostrich being the fastest land bird with a long neck denoted the pace and the reach we wanted to have, respectively.</h6>\n\n<p>The colors were soothing; primary teal and complimentary amber. Colors and fonts were taken from <b>Material Design</b> to adopt the Android ecosystem. The app should not look out of place in the user’s phone.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/color-font.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"i-used-the-system-font-roboto-so-as-to-keep-the-app-size-minimum-under-4-mb\">I used the system font, Roboto, so as to keep the app size minimum, under 4 MB.</h6>\n\n<p>The users loved the simplicity of the app. You had only two diverging flows - you are either looking to borrow a book or lend it. When you were borrowing a book you were also given an option to borrow a specially packaged collection. Lending a book was easier. Either speak the book title, enter it or just scan the book’s barcode.</p>\n\n<p>I had designed the “Enter Book Title” card, with intricate detail in the animation choreography, to keep user’s attention to the same place.</p>\n\n<p>The “Profile page” component is now commonly known as “Bottom Sheet”, but was nowhere to be seen in 2015. I had always envisioned a UI where all the temporary pages like Settings, Profile etc float over the main UI. This doesn’t intrude the user’s normal flow.</p>\n\n<p>Another major component which became popular was the <a href=\"https://github.com/sahildave/Search-View-Layout\">Search View Layout</a>. I eventually released it on GitHub and with only a single line you could integrate a beautiful transition, which is now used by almost all Google Apps.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"app-flows--interactions\">App Flows &amp; Interactions</h2>\n\n<p>Below is the demo which I had recorded for pitching purposes. Writing a case study was a long shot at the moment. Please bear with the low quality gifs and videos.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/inline-search.gif\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-center\" /></p>\n\n<p>Enter Book Title: I wanted the user’s eye to remain on the card and used inline crossfade animation for that.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/profile.gif\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-center\" /></p>\n\n<p>Profile screen had a translate up animation, now called a bottom sheet. This was one of the components which became mainstream.</p>\n\n<iframe height=\"640\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rR9CcfhelBeDcTAFN1IxustPcI6AgcGe/preview\" class=\"size-small\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Borrowing a book was easy.

Ostrich ran, pretty fast, as long as it had food. They say that the Ostrich eats everything and so did we. We did corporate marketing, created and sold merchandise, travelled everyday hours in scorching heat in public transports to deliver a book, built side projects, worked out of 3 different places, organised meetups and kept our customers happy. We had over a thousand returning customers and much more readers through our corporate ventures.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the customer facing app, we started a B2B model where we created digitally maintained library for an organizations. Had many companies including PayPal India as our partner.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/gym.png\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"we-even-placed-our-books-in-a-gym-how-about-that\">We even placed our books in a gym.

It takes a great deal of courage to get out of your bubble and do things for the first time. I can’t even imagine how I went door to door to deliver a book, conversed with them about their experience, asked them for their suggestions, talked to a lot of authors, publishers &amp; distributors.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/ostrich/tired.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"size-large\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"it-was-a-helluva-ride\">It was a helluva-ride!</h6>",

      "content": "<p>Last week I was developing an internal tool to create a design workflow for my workplace. The process involved creating a style guide for a new project by setting up the branding colours, typefaces, shadows and scrim. All went well until it was required to convert the text layers into symbols so as to generalise them as well.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"problem\">Problem</h2>\n\n<p>If you use a text layer in a symbol, you can only override only the text; not any other property including font colour or weight.\nThis makes the symbol not so customisable. For example, you’d have to create multiple types of alert messages instead of just one where you can change the icon and colour.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"solution\">Solution</h2>\n\n<p>Until Sketch releases an update where you override all the properties in a text layer it would be good to convert all your text styles into text symbols and use them in your other symbols.\nIn this article, I would share some snippets which acted as utils in my project. I kept these methods in a utils.js file and imported it by adding an import statement on top my main script.</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">@import ‘utils.js’</code></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"finding-page-layer-or-symbol\">Finding page, layer or symbol</h3>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/sahildave/9ecf7ba5e96a35f6575f9c7a073e659c.js\"></script>\n\n<p>First method is generic, where a list and a key is taken as parameters and name of every element is compared with it. If there is a match, the same item is returned. The other functions are the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">findLayerByName</code> takes the artboard as the parameter and iterates over the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">artboard.layers()</code> list.</li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">findPageByName</code> the pages parameter can be fetched from the document by using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">doc.pages()</code>.</li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">findSymbolByName</code> list of symbols can be obtained by, again, using the document. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getSymbols(doc)</code> function looks like this.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"cm\">/**\n * Get all the symbols for a document.\n * @param {MSDocument} doc\n * @return {NSArray}\n */</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">getSymbols</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">doc</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">doc</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">documentData</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nx\">allSymbols</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"creating-artboard-page-textlayer--symbol\">Creating Artboard, Page, TextLayer &amp; Symbol</h3>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/sahildave/9192956b791d57e5af9f64821d5b04c6.js\"></script>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createArtboard</code> function is self explanatory. It creates a new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">MSArtboardGroup</code>, sets its name, geometry and adds it to the current page. This can be made even more generic by taking the page as a parameter.</li>\n  <li>There are two types of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createPage</code> functions. First creates a new page and adds it to the document data. Important step is to call <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">doc.loadLayerListPanel()</code> after you add the page, otherwise the page won’t appear on the left unless you collapse and expand the page list.\nThe second function creates a blank page and renames it, as simple as that.</li>\n  <li>Creating text layer also follows the same trend. One thing to remember is to add it to a page by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">page.addLayers([layer]);</code>.</li>\n  <li>Creating symbol from layer is a bit verbose. You take in a page, layer and the symbol name; add the layer to the page, convert the same layer to a new symbol, move this new symbol to the symbols page and remove the original symbol instance (which was added to the page).\nIf you pass false in the third parameter of the call: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">MSSymbolCreator. createSymbolFromLayers_withName_onSymbolsPage(layers, symbolName, true);</code> it would be added to the current page.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"show-symbols-page-get-all-symbols-get-last-symbol\">Show symbols page, get all symbols, get last symbol</h3>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/sahildave/0533d4cae6e5280d3c1e69c4ae9830d2.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Frankly, only the third function <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getBottomSymbol</code> is the interesting function in this gist. It compares the position of the symbols and use the compare function to return the appropriate integer. Comments are added to help you out.</p>\n\n<p>I am now planning to release my workflow as a plugin. It essentially would help you out to set a theme for your project. It has inbuilt palette and typeface generator.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>This post originally appeared <a href=\"https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/sketch-gists-useful-snippets-for-plugin-development-1-3-214a77097142\">here</a> on Medium</p>",

It had helped us serve different clients with different requirements.\nIn this post I would share how we release multiple split libraries and have interdependencies similar to how Google releases play-services or appcompat libraries. It seems easy till the publishing day, until it is not! The problem with inter-dependency is maven does not add the version number in the pom file for local module dependencies.",
