> We wanted to inspire a billion people to read and learn. 

Ostrich Books was started to solve problems with book availability and the high cost. Books are either not available in the local store or are costly if ordered online. Getting suggestion online is even worse. If you are an avid reader, you'd not like the Amazon and Goodreads recommendation system.  If you are an avid reader, you'd have a really bad time online.

# The Problem

There are only a few good bookstores in Bangalore and even lesser number of libraries. And after making an astronomical number of calls to a bookstore and confirming they have the book, you chicken out because of the worsening Bangalore traffic. 

Getting a suggestion for your next book on Amazon is, I would say, misleading. The pop culture and increasing number of book-to-movie adaptation have skewed the bestselling lists in Amazon India and Goodreads.

> Almost all bestselling books on Amazon India are Bollywood-esque.

# The Process

Being the designer & engineer co-founder in the team I had all the non-business responsibility. We needed a customer facing app and a working admin dashboard, and all of it in just 2 months. 

Prior to Ostrich, I had done that multiple times but the catch was that those products were from an established company. Creating a new product(s) for a new company is different. You conceptualize the logo and branding, present it, argue about it and go back to the drawing board. Developing an app comes after that. My Gantt charts were off the charts.

> Branding, development & marketing for 2 apps in 2 months is, in simple terms, not easy.

As the internet was undergoing an incredible transformation in India and the number of Android users was increasing by the day, I chose to go with Google's Material Design. It was 2015 and users were getting comfortable with this new design system. 

Next, I chose not to go with some fancy animations as phones in India are pretty slow. In one of my user interview, I saw a user open the _Book Detail_ page with an extreme stutter because of the element transition animation from the bottom. I decided to scrap that animation and went with the simple translation like a bottom sheet.

Rapid prototyping was done; not with After Effects but directly in the code. There was very little time to create a design prototype and then implementing it. I would create multiple feature branches and after testing, merge them all.

> GitFlow helped me weave through the branches

In the end, after an app update was released, we'd have learned a lot from the process and implement the design changes in our social media posts as well. I think I won't be wrong saying that iterating UI design helped us in improving our social media content too

Another result of rapid prototyping was that our internal processes were also made rapid.

> We would do the **User Research** while delivering the book.
 
We would ask them about their experience with the app. If they were a returning user, we would have a list of old conversations and interview them about the latest changes that they see.

# The Product

Eventually, we had a running product. Ostrich ran, pretty fast, as long as it had food. They say that the Ostrich eats everything and so did we. We did corporate marketing, created and sold merchandise, travelled everyday hours in scorching heat in public transports to deliver a book, built side projects, worked out of 3 different places, organised meetups and kept our customers happy. We had over a thousand returning customers and much more readers through our corporate ventures.

> We even placed our books in a gym. What about that!

# The Outcome

But the food was finite and it had to come to an end.

As a result of this experience, I grew a lot professionally and personally. It takes a great deal of courage to get out of your bubble and do things for the first time. I can't even imagine how I went door to door to deliver a book, conversed with them about their experience, asked them for their suggestions, talked to a lot of authors, publishers & distributors. All this, being an introvert! 

It was one helluva-ride!
