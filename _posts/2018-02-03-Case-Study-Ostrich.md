excerpt: Ostrich Books was started to solve problems with book availability and the high cost. Books are either not available in the local store or are costly if ordered online. Getting suggestion online is even worse. If you are an avid reader, you'd not like the Amazon and Goodreads recommendation system.  If you are an avid reader, you'd have a really bad time online.

				<h2>The Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
				<p>There are only a few good bookstores in Bangalore and even lesser number of libraries. And after making an
				astronomical number of calls to a bookstore and confirming they have the book, you chicken out because of the
				worsening Bangalore traffic. One of the biggest store in Bangalore would have almost all of the book and frankly it
				was a major point of purchase for Ostrich too; but the quality is not that great.</p>

				<h2>The Process</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
				<p>Being the designer &amp; engineer co-founder of the team, I had all the non-business responsibilities. We needed
				a customer facing app and a working admin dashboard, and all of it in just 2 months.<br>
				<br>
				Prior to Ostrich, I had done that multiple times but this time the catch was that those products were from an
				established company. Creating new product(s) for a new company is different. You conceptualize the logo, branding,
				present it, argue about it and go back to the drawing board. Developing an app comes after that.<br>
				<br>
				<i>My Gantt charts were off the charts.</i></p>

			Being the solo developer, I built the Android app, laid down the foundation for the backend, created serverless
			modules, created admin panels and many other side projects.<br>
			<br>
			I also lead the product marketing and community engagement.
		</blockquote>
		<p>As the internet was undergoing an incredible transformation in India and the number of Android users was
		increasing by the day, I chose to go with Google's Material Design. It was 2015 and users were getting comfortable
		with this new design system.<br>
		<br>
		Next, I chose not to go with some fancy animations as phones in India are pretty slow. In one of my user interview, I
		saw a user open the <i>Book Detail</i> page with an extreme stutter because of the element transition animation from
		the bottom. I decided to scrap that animation and went with the simple translation like a bottom sheet.</p>

			Rapid prototyping was done; not with After Effects but directly in the code. There was very little time to create a

		</blockquote>
	</section>
	<section id="padding-extra">
		Another result of rapid prototyping was that our internal processes were also made rapid. We would do the <b>User
		Research</b> while delivering the book. We would ask them about their experience with the app. If they were a
		returning user, we would have a list of old conversations and interview them about the latest changes that they
		see.<br>

			<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
				<p>Ostrich was launched. To promote reading and making it easy was our main objective.<br>
				You search for a book and start reading a physical copy in a matter of hours.<br>
				You can lend your own books and get 3 in return.<br>
				You could rent a full book set or buy it at a discounted price.<br>
				Meet an author or chat with fellow readers at specially organised event.<br>

		<p>In the end, after an app update was released, we'd have learned a lot from the process and implement the design
		changes in our social media posts as well. I think I won't be wrong saying that iterating UI design helped us in
		improving our social media content too.</p>

		<p>The users loved the simplicity of the app. You had only two diverging flows - you are either looking to borrow a
		book or lend it. When you were borrowing a book you were also given an option to borrow a specially packaged
		collection. Lending a book was easier. Either speak the book title, enter it or just scan the book's barcode.<br>
		<br>
		I had designed the "Enter Book Title" card, with intricate detail in the animation choreography, to keep user's
		attention to the same place.<br>
		<br>
		The "Profile page" component is now commonly known as "Bottom Sheet", but was nowhere to be seen in 2015. I had
		always envisioned a UI where all the temporary pages like Settings, Profile etc float over the main UI. This doesn't
		intrude the user's normal flow.<br>
		<br>
		Another major component which became popular was the <a href="https://github.com/sahildave/Search-View-Layout">Search
		View Layout</a>. I eventually released it on GitHub and with only a single line you could integrate a beautiful
		transition, which is now used by almost all Google Apps.</p>

				<p>As a result of this experience, I grew a lot professionally and personally. It takes a great deal of courage to

				book, conversed with them about their experience, asked them for their suggestions, talked to a lot of authors,
				publishers &amp; distributors.<br>
