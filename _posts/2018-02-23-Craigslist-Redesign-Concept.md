<p>This was a super fun project even with all the limitations that craigslist's information architecture had to offer. Redesigning craigslist as just another e-commerce website is not difficult; the challenge is keeping the returning user to feel at home.
<br><br>In this project, I focussed on making the website friendlier. A new look is created taking advantage of the widescreens that we have today.</p>
