I have been designing and developing for more than 4 years.

Currently in Bangalore, I love to create user-centric design for the problems at hand. If there is a need to develop them, I can do that as well.
In the past, I’ve also helped in creating "Juspay Safe”; The world’s first mobile payment browser used by all major companies including Uber, Amazon and Flipkart. I had my own digital library startup where I had designed & developed Android app, dashboards and website. 

I love to travel and make sure I am out of the city at least once a month. My last favourite destination was Taiwan.
