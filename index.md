I have been designing and developing for more than 3 years.

Currently at Juspay Technologies, Bangalore, I create systems and bridges between design and development teams.

I’ve also helped in creating "Juspay Safe”; The world’s first mobile payment browser for secure 1–Click experience. It’s being used by all top companies in India including Uber, Amazon and Flipkart.
